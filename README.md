## Development Progress Log

### 2025-09-09 - Initial Setup & Testing

#### ‚úÖ Repository Setup
- **13:00** - Initialized git repository and connected to GitHub remote
- **13:01** - Merged with existing advanced PRCA scraper code from remote repository
- **13:02** - Successfully pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/duggiephresh/prca-scraper

#### ‚úÖ Apify Platform Integration  
- **18:01** - First build attempt failed: `File ".actor/INPUT_SCHEMA.json" does not exist!`
- **18:02** - **FIXED**: Moved `INPUT_SCHEMA.json` to `.actor/` directory as required by Apify platform
- **18:07** - **SUCCESS**: Actor build succeeded on Apify platform

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial Runtime Issues
- **18:07** - First run encountered selector timeout: `Waiting for selector 'a' failed`
- **18:08** - Issue: PRCA website requires JavaScript, scraper not waiting long enough for content load

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced Results vs Daysheet Handling
- **18:10** - **IMPROVED**: Enhanced logging to distinguish Results (üéØ) vs Daysheets (üìã)
- **18:11** - **ADDED**: Multiple selector fallback strategy for better page loading
- **18:12** - **ENHANCED**: Detailed queue logging showing counts of each type
- **18:13** - **IMPLEMENTED**: Individual URL tracking and extraction metrics

#### Current Status
- **Build**: ‚úÖ Successful on Apify platform
- **Structure**: ‚úÖ Proper `.actor/` directory configuration
- **Logging**: ‚úÖ Enhanced with visual indicators and detailed metrics
- **Testing**: üîÑ Ready for testing with both Results and Daysheet extraction

#### Next Steps
1. Test updated scraper with `includeDaysheets: true`
2. Monitor logs for improved selector handling
3. Verify both Results and Daysheet data extraction
4. Optimize for production workloads

#### Key Files Modified
- `src/routes.js` - Enhanced logging and selector strategies
- `.actor/INPUT_SCHEMA.json` - Moved to correct Apify directory
- `README.md` - Added progress tracking
